# Swift-1-final-project
Application for guessing State Capitals

Application was created to satisfy my final project for Swift 1.
The application randomly generates a state image and users must enter the state captial.
A score is kept throughout the process of the game and will notifiy users via alert for correct or incorrect answer.

What I learned:
  - Correct switch handling
  - UIKit usages
  - AlertController practices
  - Action button functions
  - Proper Outlet creation
  
Challenges I faced:
  - Synching the randomly generated image to match correct answer
  - Score count incrementing
  - Handling mismatched user text entry
  
To do: 
  - Allow for different quizzes to be selected
  - Store user statistics based on win vs loss
  - Create a game timer
